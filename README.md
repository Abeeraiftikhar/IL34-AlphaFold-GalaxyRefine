# IL34-AlphaFold-GalaxyRefine
In-Silico Structure Prediction and Validation of Human Interleukin-34 Using AlphaFold ColabFold, and GalaxyRefine.

This repository contains the complete workflow for the in-silico structure prediction, validation, and refinement of Human Interleukin-34 (IL-34) protein (UniProt ID: Q8WWI3).

The study employs AlphaFold Database models and independent ColabFold predictions, followed by structural quality assessment using ERRAT, Verify3D, and PROCHECK. Due to low confidence in the initial models, further refinement was performed using GalaxyRefine to improve stereochemical quality and structural stability.

The final refined structure was selected based on multiple validation metrics, including MolProbity score, Ramachandran favored regions, clash score, and RMSD.

This repository serves as a practical example of computational protein structure modeling and validation for students and researchers in bioinformatics and structural biology.
